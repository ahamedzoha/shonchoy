# Task Breakdown for Shonchoy Development

This task breakdown is structured logically and sequentially, following a standard software development lifecycle (SDLC) approach: **Planning & Setup**, **Backend Development**, **Frontend Development**, **Integration & Features**, **Testing & QA**, **Deployment & Launch**, and **Post-MVP Iterations**. Each phase includes detailed sub-tasks that can be directly converted into assignable tickets (e.g., in Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues). Tickets should include:

- **Assignee**: e.g., Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, Designer, QA.
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low.
- **Dependencies**: Preceding tasks.
- **Estimation**: Rough story points or time (e.g., 1-2 days).
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable outcomes.

The breakdown prioritizes MVP features first, with references to the PRD and Tech Spec. Total estimated timeline: 8-12 weeks for MVP, assuming a small team (2-3 devs, 1 designer/QA).
